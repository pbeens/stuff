COURSE CSE2240: ROBOTICS PROGRAMMING 2

Level: Intermediate

Prerequisites: CSE1240: Robotics Programming 1
 CSE1120: Structured Programming 2
 
Description: Students add to their understanding of robotics programming by employing procedural programming techniques and fundamental data structures to create programs that display greater agency and autonomy. They learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug robotics algorithms and programs in which modularity is achieved through subprograms such as functions and fundamental data structures such as arrays.

Parameters: Access to appropriate computer equipment, software, support materials and the Internet. More specifically, students must have access to either the physical (real) or virtual (simulated) robotic environments they will require to design, write and debug Robot Control Language (RCL) scripts or programs.
