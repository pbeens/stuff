COURSE CSE3110: ITERATIVE ALGORITHM 1

Level: Advanced

Prerequisite: CSE2120: Data Structures 1

Description: Students learn a number of standard iterative data processing algorithms useful for working with data structures such as arrays. These include an iterative version of the binary search, the three basic sorts—exchange (bubble), insertion and selection, and a simple merge. In the process, they learn when and where to apply these algorithms. Parameters: Access to appropriate computer equipment, software, the Internet and support materials. Access to an object-oriented programming environment that encourages a formal treatment of objects.

2. create and/or modify algorithms that use searches, sorts and merges to solve problems
	2.1 demonstrate the use of appropriate general design techniques for the programming environment being considered for implementation
	2.2 analyze and decompose the problem into appropriate subsections using the decomposition techniques appropriate for the chosen design approach
	2.3 evaluate subsections and identify any that may require some type of search, sort and/or merge algorithm, based on the nature of the data to be processed and the type of processing operations
	2.4 identify which algorithms are appropriate or required to search, sort and/or merge data 
	2.5 sequence the various subsections appropriately
	2.6 test and modify the developing algorithm with appropriate data using a “fail-on-paper” process

3. create and/or modify programs that use searches, sorts and merges to solve problems algorithm’s design
	3.1 convert algorithms calling for standard iterative structures into programs that reflect the
	3.2 use original (user-created) or pre-existing search, sort and/or merge algorithms appropriate to the data being manipulated
	3.3 utilize the appropriate operators, methods, functions or procedures required to carry out the standard algorithms
	3.4 use internal and external documentation

4. compare program operation and outcomes with the intent of the algorithm and modify, as required
	4.1 use appropriate error-trapping mechanisms built into the programming environment, as well as programmer-directed error-trapping techniques, to eliminate logic errors and debug the program
	4.2 compare the congruency between the outcomes of the debugged program and the original intent of the algorithm and modify both, as required
